# Unified Strategizer Architecture

*December 26, 2025 — Reconciliation Document*

---

## Executive Summary

This document reconciles the multi-grid architecture exploration with the original ABSTRACT-STRATEGIZER-NOTES.md vision. The key insight: **multi-grids are one layer of a larger system, not the whole system.**

The full architecture has:
- **5 Core Units** (Concept, Dialectic, Scenario, Actor, Instrument)
- **Multi-Grid Analytical Structure** (how we decompose each unit type)
- **Shackle-Inspired Epistemic Infrastructure** (uncertainty, cruciality, kaleidic triggers)
- **The Generative Process** (friction → coin → test → abstract → promote)
- **Interlocutor Modeling** (response simulation from harvested materials)

## Part 2: The 5 Core Units — Not Grid Types

The critical error in the multi-grid document was treating these as grid types. They're not. They're **distinct strategic objects** with different structures, purposes, and behaviors.

### Unit 1: CONCEPT (Crystallized Meaning)

**What it is:** A named, reusable way of carving up reality. In theory: a concept. In foundation: a "play." In brand: a "position." In government: a "policy frame."

**Examples:**
- Theory: "Comprador Dependency" — a new way of understanding European tech firms
- Foundation: "Media Ecosystem Resilience" — shift from outlet independence to system properties
- Brand: "Restrained Intensity" — Gucci's intensity without the volume
- Government: "Regional Manufacturing Hub" — Ghana as ECOWAS industrial base

**The generative moment:**
> "None of our existing concepts carve reality correctly here. We need to coin something new."

**Hegelian move:** New concept that subsumes the limitation of existing ones.

---

### Unit 2: DIALECTIC (Productive Tension)

**What it is:** A named trade-off that must be navigated, not resolved. These remain productive until the right conditions allow sublation.

**Examples:**
- Theory: "Rigor ↔ Accessibility" — the tension in writing for different audiences
- Foundation: "Visibility ↔ Protection" — being seen legitimizes but endangers grantees
- Brand: "Heritage ↔ Novelty" — how much to preserve vs. reinvent
- Government: "Growth ↔ Equity" — fast growth concentrates; redistribution slows

**The generative moment:**
> "We're facing a trade-off that doesn't have a name in our doctrine. Let's name it."

**Hegelian move:** Higher-order insight that dissolves the apparent dichotomy:
> "Independence *is* a relational property. The dichotomy was false."

---

### Unit 3: SCENARIO (Coherent Future Path)

**What it is:** NOT just "if X then Y" forecasting. Varsavsky's insight: scenarios are **qualitatively different ways things could unfold** — internally coherent, value-laden, branching futures.

**Examples:**
- Theory: "Framework Evolution" — if we push the Deleuzian line, it leads to process philosophy; if Brandomian, to pragmatist social theory
- Foundation: "Intervention Pathway" — institution-building path (slow, durable) vs. movement-support path (fast, volatile)
- Brand: "Brand Trajectory" — heritage-luxury path (Hermès model) vs. fashion-luxury path (Balenciaga model)
- Government: "Development Style" — Industrial Champion (Korea) vs. Services Leapfrog (India) vs. Agricultural Transformation (Ethiopia)

**Why Varsavsky matters:**
- Scenarios embed VALUES — choosing a path is political/ethical, not just technical
- Scenarios are internally coherent — each has its own logic that makes other choices downstream "natural"
- Scenarios have branching points — moments where you could switch paths
- Scenarios have TRADE-OFF resolutions — each path implicitly resolves certain dialectics

**Key schema properties:**
```json
{
  "internal_logic": "what makes this path cohere",
  "implied_trade_offs": ["how this path resolves key tensions"],
  "branching_points": ["moments where path could change"],
  "end_state_description": "what success looks like on this path",
  "value_commitments": ["what values this path embeds"]
}
```

**The generative moment:**
> "The existing scenarios don't capture what's possible here. We need a new path."

---

### Unit 4: ACTOR (Entity with Agency)

**What it is:** NOT just stakeholders (passive). Actors are entities whose **responses shape outcomes**. They act and react — their moves constrain ours.

**Examples:**
- Theory: "Interlocutors" — the Marxist tradition will read this as X; the postcolonial tradition as Y
- Foundation: "Strategic Players" — government, opposition, EU, other funders, local civil society
- Brand: "Market Actors" — Hermès (will ignore), LVMH (will counter), customers (will interpret)
- Government: "Development Actors" — domestic firms, multinationals, labor, regional elites, IMF, China

**Key insight:** Your moves don't land in a vacuum. Actor responses change the meaning of what you did.

**Key schema properties:**
```json
{
  "interests": ["what they want"],
  "capabilities": ["what they can do"],
  "likely_responses": {
    "scenario_a": "how they'd respond",
    "scenario_b": "how they'd respond"
  },
  "veto_power": true|false,
  "coalition_potential": "can we align with them?"
}
```

**The generative moment:**
> "There's an actor we haven't modeled whose response will matter. We need to add them."

---

### Unit 5: INSTRUMENT (Available Tool)

**What it is:** The specific tools available for action. What you can actually DO in each domain.

**Examples:**
- Theory: "Analytical Operations" — critique, synthesis, genealogy, reconstruction, conceptual engineering
- Foundation: "Intervention Types" — grant, convene, advocate, litigate, research, capacity-build, exit
- Brand: "Strategic Moves" — launch, extend, reposition, prune, acquire, license, collaborate
- Government: "Policy Instruments" — tax, subsidize, regulate, invest, procure, coordinate, enforce

**Varsavsky insight:** Instruments aren't neutral. Each tool embeds assumptions and creates path dependencies.

**Key schema properties:**
```json
{
  "preconditions": ["what must be true to use this"],
  "resource_requirements": {"fiscal": "high|medium|low", "time": "immediate|short|medium|long"},
  "effects": {"direct": [], "signaling": []},
  "actor_responses": {"actor_a": "likely response"},
  "combinability": ["instruments this works well with"]
}
```

**The generative moment:**
> "Our existing instruments don't address this problem. We need a new type of action."

## Part 3: Where Multi-Grid ACTUALLY Lives

The multi-grid architecture is **Layer 3** — it's about how we analytically decompose WITHIN each unit type.

### Grids FOR Concepts

When we're working on a CONCEPT unit (a play, a position, a policy frame), we can analyze it through multiple lenses:

| Grid Type | What It Probes | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| LOGICAL | Is the argument sound? | "Media Ecosystem Resilience" — what premises support this? What follows? |
| FUNCTIONAL | What rhetorical work does it do? | How does this concept function in advocacy vs. grantmaking contexts? |
| THROUGHLINE | What threads does it serve? | How does it connect to our broader theory of change? |
| EVIDENTIAL | What evidence supports/challenges it? | What cases show ecosystem resilience working? |
| DIMENSIONAL | 12 philosophical signals | Porterian position? Resource-based assumptions? Political implications? |

### Grids FOR Actors

When we're working on an ACTOR unit, we can analyze it through:

| Grid Type | What It Probes | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| INTEREST | What do they want? | IMF: stability, market orientation, conditionality leverage |
| CAPABILITY | What can they do? | IMF: block financing, set conditions, provide legitimacy |
| COALITION | Who aligns with whom? | IMF + domestic technocrats vs. populist coalition |
| RESPONSE | How would they react to our moves? | If we do X, IMF likely does Y |
| HISTORICAL | Past behavior patterns | IMF responses to similar situations in comparable countries |

### Grids FOR Scenarios

When we're working on a SCENARIO unit (a development style, an intervention pathway), we can analyze it through:

| Grid Type | What It Probes | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| TEMPORAL | What happens when? | Industrial Champion: SEZs (year 1-2) → tariffs (year 3-5) → export push (year 6-10) |
| TRADE-OFF | How does this path resolve tensions? | Growth > Equity initially, Urban > Rural |
| BRANCHING | Where could the path change? | Year 3: if SEZs aren't attracting investment, reconsider |
| ACTOR-RESPONSE | How do actors respond to this path? | MNCs skeptical, labor supportive, IMF worried |
| SHACKLE | Surprise profile, cruciality, triggers | Focus gain: becomes model. Focus loss: political capital exhausted. |

### The Three-Tier System Still Applies

For each unit type, the three-tier grid system operates:

- **Tier 1 (Required):** Grids that are always needed for this unit type
- **Tier 2 (Flexible):** Grids from taxonomy, recommended based on domain/context
- **Tier 3 (Wildcard):** Novel grids invented for this specific unit instance

## Part 4: Shackle — Not a Grid, An Epistemic Layer

Shackle's framework is **orthogonal to grids** — it applies to ALL units. Every unit gets an epistemic status.

## Part 5: The Generative Process — Workflow, Not Structure

The generative process is **how work happens**, not a grid or unit type.

## Part 6: Interlocutor Modeling — Research Infrastructure

Interlocutors (theoretical schools in theory; strategic actors in strategy) get modeled from **harvested materials**.

### The Process

```
1. DEFINE INTERLOCUTOR
   • Name, type, role in your decision

2. COMMISSION HARVESTING
   → AI Research Service gathers materials:
   • Theory: Published works, interviews, reviews
   • Foundation: Statements, reports, past actions
   • Brand: Press, financials, campaigns
   • Government: Speeches, budgets, past policies

3. EXTRACT PATTERNS
   • What do they consistently say/do?
   • What triggers what responses?
   • What are their revealed preferences?

4. BUILD RESPONSE MODEL
   • Rule-based patterns for predictable responses
   • LLM prompt template for novel situations
   • Confidence levels per pattern

5. CALIBRATE
   • Test against historical cases
   • Identify gaps and biases

6. DEPLOY IN WORKFLOW
   • Available for consultation
   • Surface objections, conditions
   • Identify blind spots
```

### Example: Theory Interlocutor Panel

## Part 7: Research Commissioning — Gap Detection and Filling

When epistemic gaps are detected across any unit type, the research commissioning system activates:

```
GAP DETECTED (in any unit)
     ↓
Generate plain-language research query
     ↓
Send to AI Research Service
     ↓
Service synthesizes from:
  • Academic literature
  • Press coverage
  • Policy documents
  • Expert commentary
  • Historical cases
     ↓
Returns structured output:
  • Summary findings
  • Key sources
  • Confidence assessment
  • Remaining uncertainties
  • Suggested follow-up queries
  • EMERGENT ITEMS (new actors, tensions, scenarios discovered)
     ↓
System integrates findings:
  • Updates relevant units
  • Recalculates confidence
  • May surface new units to consider
     ↓
Re-run gap detection
```

## Part 8: Reconciliation Summary

### What the Multi-Grid Document Got Right

1. **Dynamic structure generation** — grids should be generated, not fixed
2. **Three-tier system** — required/flexible/wildcard is a good pattern
3. **Grid health metrics** — saturation, coherence, coverage are useful
4. **Gating rules** — later work depends on earlier work being healthy
5. **Multi-agent architecture** — Generator/Filler/Refactorer is reasonable

### What the Multi-Grid Document Got Wrong

1. **Collapsed the 5 units into grid types** — Scenario, Actor, Instrument aren't grids
2. **Demoted Varsavsky** — Development Styles are a UNIT TYPE, not a "SCENARIO grid"
3. **Demoted Shackle** — Epistemic infrastructure is ORTHOGONAL, not a grid enhancement
4. **Lost the Generative Process** — friction → coin → test → abstract → promote
5. **Minimized Interlocutor Modeling** — this is major infrastructure, not a sidebar

### The Corrected Architecture

| Layer | What It Is | Multi-Grid Role |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **Layer 5: Artifact** | The deliverable (essay, strategy, plan) | N/A |
| **Layer 4: 5 Units** | Concept, Dialectic, Scenario, Actor, Instrument | N/A — these are unit TYPES, not grids |
| **Layer 3: Grids** | Analytical lenses WITHIN each unit type | THIS is where multi-grid lives |
| **Layer 2: Epistemic** | Shackle (surprise, cruciality, triggers) | Orthogonal — applies to all units |
| **Layer 1: Generative** | Friction → Coin → Test → Abstract → Promote | Workflow, not structure |
| **Layer 0: Doctrine** | Accumulated validated units | What gets promoted |

---

## Part 9: Next Steps

### Documentation Updates Needed

1. **Rename `multi-grid-strategizer-architecture.md`** to `analytical-grid-layer-architecture.md`
2. **Update it** to position grids as Layer 3, not the whole system
3. **Create unit-type schemas** for each of the 5 unit types with proper structure
4. **Document Shackle integration** as a cross-cutting concern
5. **Document the Generative Workflow** as the process that ties everything together

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Unit Type Models** — proper schemas for Concept, Dialectic, Scenario, Actor, Instrument
2. **Grid Layer** — multi-grid architecture WITHIN each unit type
3. **Epistemic Layer** — Shackle status on all units
4. **Interlocutor Models** — response simulation infrastructure
5. **Research Commissioning** — gap detection and AI research integration
6. **Generative Workflow** — the friction → coin → test → promote process

### Open Questions (from ABSTRACT-STRATEGIZER-NOTES.md)

These remain valid and should guide implementation:

1. **UI/UX for the generative moment** — how to make coining new units natural
2. **When to sublate** — recognizing when dialectics are ready for resolution
3. **Cross-domain borrowing** — translation between domains
4. **Doctrine versioning** — tracking evolution of stable doctrine
5. **Interlocutor calibration** — validating simulated vs. actual responses
6. **Cruciality thresholds** — when to block decisions pending research

---

## Conclusion

The multi-grid architecture is ONE LAYER of a larger system. The full strategizer needs:

- **5 distinct unit types** (not grid types)
- **Multi-grid analysis within each unit type** (Layer 3)
- **Shackle's epistemic infrastructure** (orthogonal concern)
- **The generative process** (workflow for creating and promoting new units)
- **Interlocutor modeling** (response simulation from harvested materials)
- **Research commissioning** (gap detection and AI-powered filling)

Varsavsky's scenarios and Shackle's uncertainty framework are **core architectural elements**, not enhancements to a grid system. They shape how we think about futures, decisions, and knowledge — not just how we decompose analytical structure.
