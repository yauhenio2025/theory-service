# Abstract Strategizer Notes

## Transposing Theory-Making Architecture to Strategic Domains

*Notes from exploration session - December 2025*

---

## Context

The theory-service has a sophisticated multi-layered dimensional framework for concept analysis:
- **12 philosophical traditions** (Quine, Sellars, Brandom, Deleuze, Bachelard, Canguilhem, Davidson, Blumenberg, Carey, Kuhn, Foucault, Pragmatists)
- **8 analytical dimensions** that organize operational approaches
- **9 relationship dimensions** for capturing inter-concept complexity
- **Dialectic tensioning** using weight-toward-pole system

This document explores what the equivalent dimensions and generative processes would be for **strategic domains** (foundations like OSF, corporations like Gucci).

---

## Part 1: Dimensional Mapping

### Layer 1: The 8 Core Strategic Dimensions

| Theory Dimension | Core Question (Theory) | **Strategy Dimension** | Core Question (Strategy) |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| POSITIONAL | How does this connect to other beliefs? | **POSITIONING** | Where do we stand relative to alternatives/competitors? |
| GENEALOGICAL | Where does this concept come from? | **PROVENANCE** | What's the historical/institutional origin of this approach? |
| PRESUPPOSITIONAL | What does this take for granted? | **FOUNDATIONAL** | What capabilities/resources do we assume we have? |
| COMMITMENT | What commitments does using this involve? | **ENTAILMENT** | What does this choice commit us to? What's foreclosed? |
| AFFORDANCE | What does this make possible/visible? | **AFFORDANCE** | What does this enable? What does it blind us to? |
| NORMALIZATION | What norms/values does this embed? | **STAKEHOLDER** | Whose interests does this serve? What values are embedded? |
| BOUNDARY | What are the limits and anomalies? | **BOUNDARY** | What's the scope? What's explicitly excluded? What breaks this? |
| DYNAMIC | What tensions/transformations does this create? | **DYNAMIC** | What tensions must be managed? What evolution does this enable/block? |

---

### Layer 2: The 12 Strategic Signals (Equivalents to Philosophical Traditions)

Just as theory has Quinean, Brandomian, Deleuzian perspectives, strategy has its own intellectual traditions:

| # | Philosophy | Theory Question | **Strategy Tradition** | Strategic Question |
|---|------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Quinean** | Web position, inference patterns | **Porterian** | Competitive position, value chain linkages, five forces position |
| 2 | **Sellarsian** | Hidden assumptions, "the given" | **Resource-Based** | What capabilities do we take for granted? What's our foundational advantage? |
| 3 | **Brandomian** | Commitments, entitlements | **Game-Theoretic** | What does this move commit us to? What counter-moves does it invite? |
| 4 | **Deleuzian** | Problems addressed, becomings | **Dynamic Capabilities** | What transformation does this enable? What organizational becoming? |
| 5 | **Bachelardian** | Epistemological breaks, obstacles | **Path Dependence** | What are we breaking from? What legacy constraints must be overcome? |
| 6 | **Canguilhem** | Embedded values, interests | **Stakeholder** | Whose interests? What normative commitments? Who gains/loses? |
| 7 | **Davidson** | Reasoning styles, visibility | **Sensemaking** | How do we interpret this situation? What's our strategic logic? |
| 8 | **Blumenberg** | Root metaphors, metaphor work | **Narrative** | What's the story we tell? What metaphors organize our strategy? |
| 9 | **Carey** | Component concepts, combination | **Modular** | What capabilities/resources combine? What emerges from the combination? |
| 10 | **Kuhnian** | Paradigm, exemplars, anomalies | **Disruption** | Are we in normal competition or paradigm shift? What anomalies signal change? |
| 11 | **Foucauldian** | Power-knowledge, governmentality | **Political** | Who has power? How is control exercised? What discourse shapes possibility? |
| 12 | **Pragmatist** | Cash value, practical consequences | **Effectuation** | What can we actually do with current means? What emerges from action? |

### Layer 3: Strategic Relationship Dimensions (for comparing Options/Initiatives)

When comparing two strategic options (like comparing two concepts), analyze along these dimensions:

| Theory Relationship | Captures | **Strategy Relationship** | Captures |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------|----------|
| Sellarsian | Shared/contested foundational givens | **Resource Overlap** | Shared vs. contested capabilities, same foundation? |
| Brandomian | Inferential commitments | **Strategic Entailment** | Do commitments of A conflict with B? Complementary? |
| Deleuzian | Problematic relation | **Problem-Solution Fit** | Same problem differently? Different problems? |
| Hacking | Reasoning style compatibility | **Logic Compatibility** | Same strategic logic? Conflicting assumptions? |
| Bachelardian | Rupture/continuity | **Path Relationship** | A leads to B? B breaks from A? Independent? |
| Quinean | Web of beliefs position | **Portfolio Coherence** | How do A and B fit in overall portfolio? |
| Carey | Conceptual composition | **Combinatorial** | Can A and B combine? What emerges? |
| Blumenberg | Root metaphors | **Narrative Coherence** | Same story? Competing stories? |
| Canguilhem | Norms, interests | **Stakeholder Alignment** | Serve same interests? Conflict? |

---

### Layer 4: Strategic Dialectics

The dialectic structure translates directly:

**Theory Dialectic:**
```
tension_a ↔ tension_b
weight_toward_a: 0.0-1.0
status: draft|active|resolved|deprecated
```

**Strategy Dialectic (same structure):**
```
position_a ↔ position_b
weight_toward_a: 0.0-1.0
status: draft|active|resolved|deprecated
```

**Examples:**

| Domain | tension_a | tension_b |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Foundation | Visible intervention (legitimacy) | Quiet funding (grantee protection) |
| Foundation | Build local capacity | Rapid impact through external actors |
| Brand | Heritage preservation | Contemporary relevance |
| Brand | Exclusivity (scarcity) | Accessibility (growth) |
| Corporation | Organic growth (control) | Acquisition (speed) |
| Corporation | Focus (depth) | Diversification (resilience) |

---

### Domain Vocabulary Translation

```python
STRATEGY_SIGNAL_TO_DIMENSION = {
    # Core positioning
    "porterian": StrategicDimension.POSITIONING,

    # Foundational
    "resource_based": StrategicDimension.FOUNDATIONAL,

}
```

### The Artifact Connection

| Domain | Artifact | Spine | Pillars | Blocks |
|--------|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| Theory/Writing | Essay | Thesis | Main sections | Arguments, evidence, examples |
| Foundation | Strategy Document | Theory of Change | Strategic Objectives | Interventions, grants, activities |
| Brand | Brand Strategy | Positioning | Strategic Pillars | Initiatives, campaigns, products |

## Part 2: The Generative Process

### The Key Insight

Concepts already presuppose prior paradigms and relations to other concepts. They are meaningful only through relations. In theory-building, the **currency** is:
- **Coining new concepts**
- **Discovering new tensions/frictions**
- **Keeping them productive until resolved at higher abstraction** (the Hegelian move)

The question: what is the equivalent generative process in strategy?

---

### The Generative Process in Theory

```
EXISTING FRAMEWORK          PROJECT WORK              NEW KNOWLEDGE
(concepts, dialectics)  →   (essay, book)        →   (new concepts, dialectics)
                              ↓
                        Face a CHOICE
                              ↓
                        Existing concepts
                        don't quite fit
                              ↓
                        FRICTION reveals
                        something missing
                              ↓
                        COIN new concept
                        or NAME new tension
                              ↓
                        If it works,
                        it goes upstream
```

The **Hegelian move**: A tension (A ↔ B) gets "resolved" not by picking a side but by finding a higher-order concept C that contains both A and B as moments within it.

---

### Equivalent Units in Strategy

#### For Foundations

| Theory Unit | Strategy Equivalent | What It Is | Example |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------| --------|
| **Concept** | **Play** | A named, reusable strategic pattern with specific conditions of application | "The Media-First Sequence" — in semi-authoritarian contexts, build media capacity before judicial reform |
| **Dialectic** | **Strategic Tension** | A named trade-off that must be navigated, not resolved | "Visibility ↔ Protection" — being seen legitimizes but endangers grantees |
| **Hegelian Sublation** | **Doctrine Upgrade** | A higher-order principle that resolves a tension by reframing it | "The Visibility-Protection tension dissolves when you separate *who* is visible (us) from *who* acts (them)" |

#### For Corporations/Brands

| Theory Unit | Strategy Equivalent | What It Is | Example |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------| --------|
| **Concept** | **Position** (coined) | A new way of carving up the competitive space that reveals opportunity | "Quiet Maximalism" — Gucci's heritage codes at minimal volume (not existing category) |
| **Dialectic** | **Brand Tension** | A named trade-off at the heart of brand identity | "Heritage ↔ Novelty" — how much to preserve vs. reinvent |
| **Hegelian Sublation** | **Brand Doctrine Upgrade** | Resolution that transcends the tension | "Heritage *through* Novelty — reinterpretation IS the heritage" |

---

### Walkthrough: Foundation Example (OSF Considering Moldova)

**Phase 1: Apply Existing Framework**

Existing plays in doctrine:
- "Fund independent media"
- "Support civil society organizations"
- "Build judicial capacity"

Existing tensions:
- "Visibility ↔ Protection"
- "Local ownership ↔ Quality control"

**Phase 2: Project Work Creates Friction**

Working on Moldova strategy, you try to apply "Fund independent media."

But:
- The media landscape is fragmented
- Some outlets that *look* independent are actually captured
- The usual indicators (audience size, editorial independence) don't predict resilience
- Your existing concept of "independent media" doesn't carve reality correctly here

**Phase 3: Friction Reveals the Gap**

The friction isn't about *execution*. It's about *conception*.

Realization: the concept "independent media" assumes a binary (independent vs. captured). But in Moldova, there's a spectrum, and position on the spectrum is *dynamic* — outlets move in and out of capture.

**Phase 4: The Generative Moment — Coin New Play**

Option A: **Coin a New Concept**
> "Media Ecosystem Resilience" — not individual outlet independence, but system-level properties: diversity of ownership, redundancy of coverage, speed of information flow when one node is captured

This is a new way of carving up the strategic space. It's not in the existing playbook.

Option B: **Name a New Tension**
> "Outlet Independence ↔ Ecosystem Resilience" — funding strong individual outlets may actually harm ecosystem resilience (they crowd out others, create single points of failure)

This is a tension not named before. It's productive — needs navigation, not resolution.

**Phase 5: Test in This Context**

Does "Media Ecosystem Resilience" help make better decisions in Moldova?
- Changes what you fund (infrastructure, not just content)
- Changes who you fund (connector organizations, not just producers)
- Changes metrics (network properties, not just outlet metrics)

**Phase 6: Abstract — Does It Generalize?**

Does this concept/tension apply to other semi-authoritarian contexts?
- Hungary: yes, similar ecosystem dynamics
- Egypt: maybe, but ecosystem is even more captured
- Poland: yes, but ecosystem more resilient

If it generalizes → it goes upstream to doctrine layer.

**Phase 7: The Hegelian Move (if applicable)**

Eventually, you might find that "Outlet Independence ↔ Ecosystem Resilience" gets sublated:

> "Independence *is* a relational property, not an attribute of individual outlets. An outlet's independence depends on the ecosystem it's embedded in. The dichotomy was false."

This is the higher-order insight that resolves the tension by reframing it.

---

### Walkthrough: Brand Example (Gucci Developing New Line)

**Phase 1: Apply Existing Framework**

Existing brand doctrine:
- "Italian craftsmanship"
- "Maximalist aesthetic"
- "Heritage with subversion"

Existing brand tensions:
- "Heritage ↔ Novelty"
- "Exclusivity ↔ Accessibility"

**Phase 2: Project Work Creates Friction**

Working on a potential "quiet luxury" line to compete with Bottega, Loro Piana.

Try to apply "Heritage with subversion" — but:
- Subversion implies *loud* moves (the Alessandro Michele aesthetic)
- "Quiet luxury" seems to contradict Gucci's DNA
- Existing concept doesn't help see how Gucci can play here

**Phase 3: Friction Reveals the Gap**

The concept "maximalism" assumes visible density of signifiers. But there might be a different kind of maximalism — maximal *quality*, maximal *craft*, maximal *attention* — that isn't visually loud.

**Phase 4: The Generative Moment**

Option A: **Coin a New Position**
> "Restrained Intensity" — Gucci codes (color, craft, historical reference) at *minimum* visible volume but *maximum* material intensity

This is a new way of positioning that doesn't exist in the market. It's not "quiet luxury" (which is about subtraction). It's about *where* the maximalism lives.

Option B: **Name a New Tension**
> "Volume ↔ Intensity" — you can have maximal intensity with minimal volume, or vice versa

This reframes the "loud vs. quiet" binary that was constraining thinking.

**Phase 5: Test in This Context**

Does "Restrained Intensity" help make product/communication decisions?
- Product: archival cuts, no visible logos, but extraordinary leather, unusual colors
- Comm: whisper, don't shout; reference, don't explain
- Retail: smaller spaces, more intimate, by appointment

**Phase 6: Abstract — Does It Generalize?**

Does "Restrained Intensity" apply to other Gucci challenges?
- Menswear: yes, men want intensity without volume
- Accessories: maybe — bags may need more volume to signal
- Fragrance: yes — intense scent, minimal packaging

If it generalizes → goes into brand doctrine as a new strategic concept.

**Phase 7: The Hegelian Move**

The "Heritage ↔ Novelty" tension might get sublated:

> "Heritage isn't *what* you quote, it's *how* you quote. The archival reference itself is the novelty. We don't have a heritage we apply to new situations; we have a practice of reinterpretation that IS our heritage."

## System Design Implications

### The Generative Moment

The **generative moment** happens when:

1. You're inside a project (not abstract theorizing)
2. You face a genuine choice (not just executing a plan)
3. Your existing concepts/plays don't quite fit
4. The friction is about **conception**, not execution
5. You need to coin something new to proceed

### Supporting the Generative Moment

```

     ↓
Decision Point: "What should we do here?"
     ↓
System: "Here are your existing plays/concepts that might apply"
     ↓
User: "None of these quite fit because..."
     ↓
System: "Let's diagnose the friction. What's not working?"
     ↓
[FRICTION DIAGNOSIS]
     ↓
System: "It sounds like your existing concept X doesn't carve
         reality correctly here. Do you want to:

         A) REFINE existing concept (add a condition/nuance)
         B) COIN new concept (name something that doesn't exist)
         C) NAME new tension (articulate a trade-off you're facing)
         D) BORROW from adjacent domain (is there a concept
            elsewhere that fits?)
     ↓
[GENERATIVE WORK - user coins/names/borrows]
     ↓
System: "Let's test: does [new unit] help with the decision at hand?"
     ↓

     ↓
System: "Does this generalize? Where else might it apply?"
     ↓
[If generalizable → offer to promote to doctrine layer]

## Part 3: Expanding the Unit Set — Scenarios, Actors, Instruments

### What's Missing from Concepts + Dialectics?

Current units capture:
- **Static meaning** (concepts, plays, positions)
- **Productive tension** (dialectics, strategic tensions)

But they don't capture:
- **Temporal unfolding** — how things develop over time
- **Agency** — entities whose responses shape outcomes
- **Available tools** — what you can actually do

---

### Proposed Additional Units: 3 New Types

#### 1. SCENARIOS (or "Paths" or "Styles")

**What it is:** A coherent future trajectory — not just "if X then Y" but a qualitatively different way things could unfold. Oscar Varsavsky's "estilos de desarrollo" is the paradigm case.

| Domain | Name | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Theory** | Framework Evolution | "If we push this Deleuzian line, it leads toward process philosophy; if we emphasize the Brandomian elements, it leads toward pragmatist social theory" |
| **Foundation** | Intervention Pathway | "The institution-building path (slow, durable) vs. the movement-support path (fast, volatile)" |
| **Brand** | Brand Trajectory | "The heritage-luxury path (Hermès model) vs. the fashion-luxury path (Balenciaga model)" |
| **Government (Ghana)** | Development Style | "Industrialization-led (Korea model) vs. services-led (India model) vs. agriculture-transformation (Ethiopia model)" |

**Key properties:**
```json
{
  "scenario_id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "qualitative description of this future",
  "internal_logic": "what makes this path cohere",
  "key_choices": ["choice that defines this path"],
  "implied_trade_offs": ["what you give up on this path"],
  "time_horizon": "short|medium|long",
  "reversibility": "high|medium|low|irreversible",
  "branching_points": ["moments where you could switch paths"],
  "end_state_description": "what success looks like on this path"
}
```

**The Varsavsky insight:** Scenarios aren't just forecasts. They're *value-laden* — each path embeds different priorities. The Ghana planning office isn't just predicting; they're choosing whose future they're building.

---

#### 2. ACTORS (or "Players" or "Agents")

**What it is:** An entity with agency whose responses shape outcomes. Not just stakeholders (passive) but players who act and react.

| Domain | Name | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Theory** | Interlocutors | "The analytical philosophy tradition will read this as X; the continental tradition will read it as Y" — their responses shape what your argument means |
| **Foundation** | Strategic Players | "The government, opposition, EU, other funders, local civil society" — each has interests and will respond to your moves |
| **Brand** | Market Actors | "Hermès (will ignore), LVMH (will counter), customers (will interpret), Kering HQ (will evaluate)" |
| **Government (Ghana)** | Development Actors | "Domestic firms, multinationals, labor unions, regional elites, IMF, China, diaspora" — each responds differently to policy |

**Key properties:**
```json
{
  "actor_id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "actor_type": "competitor|partner|regulator|constituency|external",
  "interests": ["what they want"],
  "capabilities": ["what they can do"],
  "constraints": ["what limits them"],
  "likely_responses": {
    "scenario_a": "how they'd respond",
    "scenario_b": "how they'd respond"
  },
  "relationship_to_us": "allied|neutral|opposed|depends",
  "power_sources": ["what gives them influence"],
  "veto_power": true|false,
  "coalition_potential": "can we align with them?"
}
```

**The game-theoretic insight:** Your moves don't land in a vacuum. Actors respond, and their responses change the meaning of what you did. The Ghana planning office can't just "implement policy" — firms, workers, international bodies all respond.

---

#### 3. INSTRUMENTS (or "Levers" or "Operations")

**What it is:** The specific tools available for action in each domain. What you can actually *do*.

| Domain | Name | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Theory** | Analytical Operations | Critique, synthesis, genealogy, reconstruction, problematization, conceptual engineering |
| **Foundation** | Intervention Types | Grant, convene, advocate, litigate, research, capacity-build, network, exit |
| **Brand** | Strategic Moves | Launch, extend, reposition, prune, acquire, license, collaborate, withdraw |
| **Government (Ghana)** | Policy Instruments | Tax, subsidize, regulate, invest, procure, coordinate, signal, negotiate, enforce |

**Key properties:**
```json
{
  "instrument_id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "what this tool does",
  "preconditions": ["what must be true to use this"],
  "resource_requirements": {
    "fiscal": "high|medium|low|none",
    "political_capital": "high|medium|low|none",
    "administrative_capacity": "high|medium|low|none",
    "time": "immediate|short|medium|long"
  },
  "effects": {
    "direct": ["immediate effects"],
    "indirect": ["second-order effects"],
    "signaling": ["what it communicates"]
  },
  "actor_responses": {
    "actor_a": "likely response",
    "actor_b": "likely response"
  },
  "reversibility": "high|medium|low|irreversible",
  "combinability": ["instruments this works well with"],
  "conflicts_with": ["instruments this undermines"]
}
```

**The Varsavsky insight:** Instruments aren't neutral. Each tool embeds assumptions and creates path dependencies. "Subsidize" implies a different state-market relationship than "coordinate." Ghana's choice of instruments shapes what kind of state they're building.

```

**The dynamics:**
- **Concepts** frame how we see the situation — they shape which scenarios seem possible
- **Dialectics** reveal tensions that must be navigated — they constrain scenario choice
- **Scenarios** are coherent paths through time — they bundle concepts, resolve some dialectics, surface others
- **Instruments** are how we act — they shape which scenarios are reachable
- **Actors** respond to our instruments — their responses determine which scenario actually unfolds

## Part 4: Ghana Planning Office — Full Example

### Fourth Domain: Government Development Planning

Adding Ghana's National Development Planning Commission as a fourth domain, inspired by Oscar Varsavsky's work on development styles and numerical experimentation.

### The Situation

Ghana wants to accelerate structural transformation. Current economy is commodity-dependent (gold, cocoa, oil). They want to build productive capacity.

### The 5 Units Applied to Ghana

#### CONCEPTS (Policy Frames)

- "Industrial policy" — state-directed sectoral intervention
- "Competitive advantage" — follow market signals
- "Leapfrogging" — skip stages via technology
- "Inclusive growth" — distribute benefits widely
- "Green transition" — decarbonize while developing

Each frames the problem differently. "Industrial policy" sees missing industries; "competitive advantage" sees distorted markets.

#### DIALECTICS (Development Trade-offs)

- **Growth ↔ Equity** — fast growth concentrates; redistribution slows growth
- **Sovereignty ↔ Integration** — global value chains bring growth but dependence
- **Urban ↔ Rural** — industry concentrates in cities; agriculture is rural
- **Present ↔ Future** — invest now vs. consume now
- **State capacity ↔ State overreach** — capable state can also capture

Each must be navigated, not resolved. Varsavsky would say: your resolution of these trade-offs *defines* your development style.

#### SCENARIOS (Development Styles)

| Scenario | Logic | Key Choices | Trade-off Resolution |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Industrial Champion** | State picks winners, builds national champions (Korea model) | Concentrate resources, protect infant industries, sacrifice short-term consumption | Growth > Equity (initially), Sovereignty > Integration |
| **Services Leapfrog** | Skip manufacturing, go straight to digital services (India model) | Invest in education/connectivity, accept manufacturing will stay abroad | Integration > Sovereignty, Urban > Rural |
| **Agricultural Transformation** | Intensify agriculture, build processing industries (Ethiopia model) | Invest in rural infrastructure, accept slower urban growth | Rural > Urban, Equity > Growth, Sovereignty > Integration |
| **Green Industrial** | Build green industries from scratch (Morocco solar model) | Accept higher costs, bet on future comparative advantage | Future > Present, Sovereignty via new dependencies |

Each scenario is internally coherent but embeds different values.

#### ACTORS (Development Players)

| Actor | Interests | Capabilities | Likely Response to Industrial Champion |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Domestic business elites** | Protect current position, access to state resources | Political influence, capital | Support if they're the champions; oppose if marginalized |
| **Multinational firms** | Market access, resource extraction, low regulation | Investment, technology, markets | Skeptical — prefer Services Leapfrog |
| **Labor unions** | Jobs, wages, security | Political mobilization | Support (manufacturing jobs) |
| **Rural constituencies** | Infrastructure, prices, land | Votes | Neutral → Oppose (urban bias) |
| **IMF / World Bank** | Macro stability, market orientation | Conditionality, legitimacy | Skeptical — prefer Services Leapfrog |
| **China** | Resource access, market for goods, geopolitical influence | Investment, infrastructure, loans | Opportunistic — will work with any scenario |
| **Diaspora** | Homeland development, investment opportunities | Remittances, skills, networks | Mixed — depends on opportunities created |

#### INSTRUMENTS (Policy Tools)

| Instrument | Preconditions | Best for Scenario | Actor Responses |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Tariff protection** | Political cover, WTO space | Industrial Champion | MNCs oppose, domestic firms support, IMF skeptical |
| **SEZ / industrial zones** | Land, infrastructure budget | Industrial Champion, Services | MNCs support, labor cautious, rural opposed if land taken |
| **Skills investment** | Time, education capacity | Services, Green Industrial | Universal support but slow payoff |
| **Agricultural input subsidies** | Fiscal space, distribution capacity | Agricultural Transformation | Rural supports, urban/fiscal hawks oppose |
| **State enterprise** | Administrative capacity, capital | Industrial Champion | Elites want in, MNCs oppose, labor supports |
| **Green procurement** | Fiscal space, import capacity | Green Industrial | MNCs support (if they win contracts), domestic firms mixed |
| **Development finance** | Relationships, creditworthiness | All (enables others) | China offers easier terms than IMF |

### Varsavsky-Style Visualization Interface

What Ghana's planning office needs to *see*:

#### 1. Scenario Comparison View

```
                 │ Industrial │ Services   │ Agricultural │ Green
                 │ Champion   │ Leapfrog   │ Transform    │ Industrial
─────────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼──────────────┼────────────
GDP Growth (10yr)│    7-8%    │    5-6%    │     4-5%     │    4-6%
Job Creation     │    High    │    Medium  │     High     │    Medium
Equity           │    Low→Med │    Low     │     High     │    Medium
Sovereignty      │    High    │    Low     │     Medium   │    Medium*
Fiscal Demand    │    High    │    Medium  │     Medium   │    High
Political Risk   │    High    │    Medium  │     Medium   │    Medium
Climate Align    │    Low     │    Medium  │     Medium   │    High
─────────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴──────────────┴────────────
                                        * new dependencies on green tech
```

#### 2. Actor Response Matrix

```
If we pursue INDUSTRIAL CHAMPION:

Actor                  │ Response      │ Power │ Coalition?
───────────────────────┼───────────────┼───────┼───────────
Domestic elites        │ Support (if in)│ High │ Yes, if chosen
MNCs                   │ Oppose        │ High  │ No
Labor                  │ Support       │ Med   │ Yes
Rural                  │ Neutral→Oppose│ Med   │ Conditional
IMF                    │ Skeptical     │ High  │ Negotiate
China                  │ Opportunistic │ High  │ Transactional
───────────────────────┴───────────────┴───────┴───────────
Net assessment: Viable if domestic coalition holds, requires
managing IMF, accepting MNC resistance
```

#### 3. Instrument Sequencing

```
INDUSTRIAL CHAMPION PATH - Suggested Sequencing

Year 1-2:  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
           │ 1. Secure development finance (China, DFIs) │
           │ 2. Identify 2-3 priority sectors            │
           │ 3. Establish SEZs with infrastructure       │
           └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
Year 3-5:  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
           │ 4. Targeted tariff protection               │
           │ 5. Skills programs aligned to sectors       │
           │ 6. State enterprise in strategic inputs     │
           └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
Year 6-10: ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
           │ 7. Export push (remove protection gradually)│
           │ 8. Supplier development programs            │
           │ 9. Technology upgrading incentives          │
           └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

DECISION POINTS:
- Year 3: Are SEZs attracting investment? If not → reconsider
- Year 5: Are jobs materializing? If not → pivot to Services
- Year 7: Are exports competitive? If not → extend protection or exit
```

#### 4. Trade-off Navigation Dashboard

```
Current Position on Key Dialectics:

Growth ◄━━━━━━━━━●━━━━━━━━━► Equity
                 ↑
        We're here (70/30)
        Industrial Champion implies: 80/20 initially → 60/40 by Year 10

Sovereignty ◄━━━━━━━●━━━━━━━━► Integration
                    ↑
           We're here (50/50)
           Industrial Champion implies: 70/30 (more sovereign)

Urban ◄━━━━━━━━━━━●━━━━━━━━━► Rural
                  ↑
         We're here (60/40)
         Industrial Champion implies: 75/25 (more urban)

⚠️ TENSION ALERT: Rural constituencies won't support 75/25.
   Consider: Agricultural processing industries in rural SEZs?
   This modifies Industrial Champion toward hybrid.
```

---

### The Generative Process with 5 Units

Just as concepts and dialectics emerge from project work, so do scenarios, actors, and instruments:

```
PLANNING WORK
     ↓
Decision: "Should we pursue Industrial Champion?"
     ↓
Apply existing scenarios → "None quite fit because Ghana has
                           unique constraints (small market,
                           oil revenue, regional position)"
     ↓
FRICTION: Existing scenarios don't capture Ghana's specificity
     ↓
GENERATIVE MOVE:
  - COIN new scenario: "Regional Manufacturing Hub" — use
    ECOWAS market, position as alternative to Nigeria
  - NAME new actor: "ECOWAS neighbors" — their response to
    Ghana's industrial ambitions matters
  - IDENTIFY new instrument: "Regional trade diplomacy" —
    negotiating ECOWAS rules is itself a policy tool
     ↓
TEST: Does this new scenario/actor/instrument help?
     ↓
ABSTRACT: Does it apply to other small-market countries?
     ↓
[If generalizable → add to planning doctrine]
```

## Summary: The Complete 5-Unit Framework

| Unit | What It Is | Generative Trigger | Hegelian Move |
|------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Concept** | Crystallized meaning | Existing frames don't fit situation | Higher-order concept that subsumes both |
| **Dialectic** | Productive tension | New trade-off surfaces in project work | Reframe that dissolves the dichotomy |
| **Scenario** | Coherent future path | Existing paths don't capture possibility | Hybrid scenario that combines elements |
| **Actor** | Entity with agency | Existing actor map misses key player | Actor category that groups similar players |
| **Instrument** | Available tool | Existing tools don't address problem | Instrument combination or innovation |

## Revised Domain Comparison (4 Domains, 5 Units)

| Unit | Theory | Foundation | Brand | Government |
|------|--------|------------|-------|------------|
| **Concept** | Concept | Play | Position | Policy Frame |
| **Dialectic** | Dialectic | Strategic Tension | Brand Tension | Development Trade-off |
| **Scenario** | Framework Evolution | Intervention Pathway | Brand Trajectory | Development Style |
| **Actor** | Interlocutor | Strategic Player | Market Actor | Development Actor |
| **Instrument** | Analytical Operation | Intervention Type | Strategic Move | Policy Instrument |
| **Artifact** | Essay, Book | Strategy Document | Campaign, Product Line | Development Plan |

---

## Open Questions

1. **UI/UX for the generative moment**: How do you make "coining a new play" or "naming a new tension" feel as natural as writing a sentence in an essay?

2. **When to sublate**: How does the system recognize when a tension is ready for Hegelian resolution vs. when it should remain productive?

3. **Cross-domain borrowing**: Can insights from foundation strategy inform brand strategy and vice versa? What's the translation mechanism?

4. **Doctrine versioning**: How do you track the evolution of doctrine over time as new plays/positions get promoted from project work?

5. **Scenario simulation**: How do you model actor responses to instrument choices? What level of formalization is useful vs. misleading?

6. **Value-laden futures**: How do you make explicit that scenario choice is political/ethical, not just technical optimization?

7. **Hybrid scenarios**: When existing scenarios don't fit, how do you systematically generate hybrid options?

8. **Instrument sequencing**: How do you represent temporal dependencies between instruments? When does order matter?

## Part 5: Shackle-Inspired Uncertainty & Epistemic Infrastructure

### The Shackle Critique

G.L.S. Shackle rejected the treatment of futures as probability distributions over known states:

- The future is **genuinely unknowable**, not just uncertain
- Decisions are often **crucial** — non-repeatable, irreversible, where you can't learn before you commit
- **Potential surprise** replaces probability — not "how likely?" but "how surprised would we be?"
- **Kaleidic change** — sudden reframings that make previous scenarios irrelevant
- **Focus outcomes** — the best and worst conceivable outcomes that aren't surprising (what actually shapes decisions)

### Epistemic Status Schema (All Units)

Every unit (concept, dialectic, scenario, actor, instrument) gets an epistemic status:

### Interlocutor Schema (Theoretical Schools & Strategic Actors)

The key insight: in theory-building, we imagine how different schools of thought would respond. This is exactly what we need for strategic actors. Both can be modeled by harvesting past positions and building response models.

```json
{
  "interlocutor_id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "type": "theoretical_school|strategic_actor|critic|audience",

  "profile": {
    "core_commitments": ["what they believe/want"],
    "characteristic_moves": ["how they typically respond"],
    "blind_spots": ["what they tend to miss"],
    "would_ask": ["questions they'd raise"],
    "would_object_to": ["what triggers their criticism"]
  },

  "response_model": {
    "model_type": "rule_based|llm_simulated|hybrid",
    "training_sources": [

      }
    ],
    "prompt_template": "For LLM simulation",
    "calibration_checks": ["historical accuracy tests"]
  },

  "epistemic_status": {
    "model_confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "last_updated": "date",
    "coverage_gaps": ["situations we can't predict"]
  }
}
```

### Building Interlocutor Models from Harvested Materials

For all domains, the process is the same:

```
1. DEFINE INTERLOCUTOR
   • Name, type, role in your decision

2. IDENTIFY SOURCE TYPES
   Theory: Published works, interviews, reviews, debates
   Foundation: Statements, reports, past actions, policy documents
   Brand: Press, financials, campaigns, executive comments
   Government: Speeches, budgets, past policies, external analysis

3. COMMISSION HARVESTING
   → AI Research Service gathers materials

4. EXTRACT PATTERNS
   • What do they consistently say/do?
   • What triggers what responses?
   • What are their revealed preferences?
   • What constraints do they cite?

5. BUILD RESPONSE MODEL
   • Rule-based patterns for predictable responses
   • LLM prompt template for novel situations
   • Confidence levels per pattern

6. CALIBRATE
   • Test against historical cases
   • Identify gaps and biases

7. DEPLOY
   • Available for consultation in project work
   • Updates epistemic status of relevant units
   • Flags when model confidence is low
```

### Open Questions (Extended)

1. **UI/UX for the generative moment**: How do you make "coining a new play" or "naming a new tension" feel as natural as writing a sentence in an essay?

2. **When to sublate**: How does the system recognize when a tension is ready for Hegelian resolution vs. when it should remain productive?

3. **Cross-domain borrowing**: Can insights from foundation strategy inform brand strategy and vice versa? What's the translation mechanism?

4. **Doctrine versioning**: How do you track the evolution of doctrine over time as new plays/positions get promoted from project work?

5. **Scenario simulation**: How do you model actor responses to instrument choices? What level of formalization is useful vs. misleading?

6. **Value-laden futures**: How do you make explicit that scenario choice is political/ethical, not just technical optimization?

7. **Hybrid scenarios**: When existing scenarios don't fit, how do you systematically generate hybrid options?

8. **Instrument sequencing**: How do you represent temporal dependencies between instruments? When does order matter?

9. **Interlocutor calibration**: How do you validate that simulated responses match actual responses? What's the feedback loop?

10. **Research integration**: How does new research change existing units? Automatic vs. human-reviewed updates?

11. **Cruciality thresholds**: At what cruciality level should the system block decisions pending more research?

12. **Cross-project learning**: How do insights from one project (e.g., Moldova) inform another (e.g., Hungary) without overfitting?
