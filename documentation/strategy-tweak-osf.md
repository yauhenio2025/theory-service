# Strategy UI Brainstorm: Porting Concept Wizard Methodology to Strategic Planning

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Context:** Brainstorming session for adapting the Theory Service's Concept Setup Wizard methodology to a new "Strategy UI" tool for foundations like Open Society Foundations.

---

## Concept Wizard: Core Architecture Summary

### What It Does
Takes users through staged questioning to articulate a novel theoretical concept across **12 philosophical dimensions**, using:

1. **Initial notes analysis** → extract preliminary understanding
2. **Blind spots questioning** → surface hidden assumptions, ambiguities
3. **Hypothesis generation** → cards representing detected claims/theses
4. **Validation & refinement** → approve/reject/transform cards
5. **Multi-stage questioning** → differentiation, methodology, genealogy, deep commitments

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **12 Dimensions** | Sellarsian, Brandomian (x2), Deleuzian, Bachelardian, etc. - different analytical lenses |
| **7 Epistemic Blind Spot Categories** | Ambiguity, Presupposition, Paradigm Dependency, Likely Misreading, Gray Zone, Unfilled Slot, Unconfronted Challenge |
| **3 Card Types** | Hypothesis Cards (claims), Genealogy Cards (influences), Differentiation Cards (what it's NOT) |
| **Transformation Modes** | Sharpen, Generalize, Radicalize, Historicize, Deepen |

## Strategy UI: The Translation

### Fundamental Reframe

| **Concept Wizard** | **Strategy Wizard** |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "What IS this?" | "What should we DO?" |
| Understanding | Action |
| Theoretical articulation | Strategic clarity |
| Concept definition | Theory of Change |

## 12 Strategic Dimensions (replacing Philosophical Dimensions)

| # | Concept Dim | Strategy Dim | What It Probes |
|---|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Definitional** (Sellarsian) | **Theory of Change** | What change you're trying to create; the causal mechanism |
| 2 | **Inferential** (Brandomian) | **Cascade Effects** | If this succeeds, what follows? What doors open? |
| 3 | **Incompatibility** (Brandomian) | **Strategic Tradeoffs** | What this rules out; opportunity costs; can't-do-both tensions |
| 4 | **Genealogical** (Carey/Blumenberg) | **Precedent & Learning** | What's been tried before? What does history teach? |
| 5 | **Transformational** (Deleuzian) | **System Dynamics** | What systemic shifts does this enable or block? |
| 6 | **Epistemological Break** (Bachelardian) | **Paradigm Challenge** | Does this challenge orthodoxy? Is this "normal grantmaking" or something new? |
| 7 | **Methodological** (Hacking) | **Implementation Logic** | How will this actually be executed? What mechanisms? |
| 8 | **Normative** (Canguilhem) | **Values & Red Lines** | What principles must not be violated? Whose values are embedded? |
| 9 | **Positional** (Quinean) | **Ecosystem Position** | Where does this fit in the landscape of actors/initiatives? |
| 10 | **Paradigmatic** (Kuhnian) | **Field-Shaping** | Does this define how the field thinks? What exemplars does it create? |
| 11 | **Performative** (Pragmatist) | **What It DOES** | Beyond stated goals - what does pursuing this strategy build/destroy? |
| 12 | **Power-Relational** (Foucauldian) | **Power Dynamics** | Whose power increases/decreases? What interests are served? |

## 7 Strategic Blind Spot Categories

| Category | Concept Wizard | Strategy Wizard |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Ambiguity** | Terms with multiple readings | "Success" means what exactly? "Civil society" - which actors? |
| **Presupposition** | Untested "givens" | "Obviously the government will cooperate..." Will it? |
| **Paradigm Dependency** | Framework lock-in | A Marxist would see class; a liberal sees institutions. Which lens are you using? |
| **Likely Misreading** | Misunderstanding risk | Grantees may think this means X when you mean Y |
| **Gray Zone** | Boundary cases | What if the authoritarian regime is *also* effective at service delivery? |
| **Unfilled Slot** | Gaps in the plan | "We'll partner with local organizations" - which ones? How? |
| **Unconfronted Challenge** | Risks not addressed | What if the opposition wins the election? What if the donor exits? |

## Card Types for Strategy

| Card Type | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Intervention Cards** | Specific proposed actions | "Multi-year core support to 5 watchdog orgs", "Convening of regional media editors" |
| **Precedent Cards** | Historical examples + lessons | "USAID democracy program in X failed because...", "EU's approach in Y worked when..." |
| **Alternative Cards** | What we're NOT doing, and why | "We chose NOT to fund direct service delivery because..." |
| **Actor Cards** *(new)* | Key stakeholders + their positions | "Ministry of Justice: ally on process reform, opponent on judicial independence" |
| **Assumption Cards** *(new)* | Testable beliefs underlying the strategy | "Assumption: Independent media can survive on domestic revenue by 2027" |
| **Risk Cards** *(new)* | Identified risks + mitigations | "Risk: Government closes civil society space. Mitigation: Emergency fund + exile support" |

## Staged Questioning for Strategy

### Stage 1: Problem & Opportunity Framing
- What's the problem/opportunity?
- Why now? What's the window?
- What's the scope? (country/region, theme, timeline)
- For whom? Who benefits if you succeed?

### Stage 2: Theory of Change
- What's the desired end state?
- What's the causal mechanism? (If we do X, then Y, because Z)
- What must be true for this to work? (Critical assumptions)
- What would falsify your theory of change?

### Stage 3: Landscape & Actors
- Who are the key players? (Allies, opponents, targets)
- What are they doing/not doing? Why?
- Where is there leverage? Where is there lock-in?
- What's the ecosystem - who else is funding this space?

### Stage 4: Intervention Design
- What specific interventions are you proposing?
- Why these tools? (Grants, advocacy, convening, research...)
- What's the sequencing? What comes first?
- What resources are required?

### Stage 5: Comparative Positioning
- What alternatives did you consider?
- Why this approach vs. others?
- What are you explicitly NOT doing? Why not?
- What's your comparative advantage?

### Stage 6: Learning & Adaptation
- How will you know if it's working?
- What leading indicators will you track?
- What would cause you to change course?
- What's the learning agenda?

### Stage 7: Power & Politics
- Whose power does this increase/decrease?
- What political dynamics must be navigated?
- What coalitions are needed?
- Who might oppose this, and why?

### Stage 8: Exit & Sustainability
- What's the exit scenario?
- What happens when funding ends?
- What must be in place for this to be sustainable?
- What's the legacy you want to leave?

## Transformation Modes for Strategy

The same modes work beautifully:

| Mode | In Strategy Context |
|------|---------------------|
| **Sharpen** | Make more specific: "Which 3 countries exactly? Which actors?" |
| **Generalize** | Make more abstract: "Could this model work across regions?" |
| **Radicalize** | Push to more ambitious: "What if you aimed for systemic change, not incremental?" |
| **Historicize** | Ground in context: "How does this connect to the 2010 reform attempt?" |
| **Deepen** | Probe mechanisms: "Why do you think CSOs actually influence policy here?" |

## OSF-Specific Considerations

For a foundation like OSF, add:

1. **Portfolio Integration** - How does this fit with other strategies in the country/region/theme?
2. **Grantee Voice** - Have grantees validated this theory of change?
3. **Risk Tolerance** - Is this a "safe bet" or a "moonshot"? Is OSF's risk appetite appropriate?
4. **Sustainability Path** - What's the phase-out plan? How does this avoid dependency?
5. **Political Economy** - What incentives are you creating? What perverse effects are possible?
6. **Learning Contribution** - Even if this specific strategy fails, what will the field learn?

## Example: What This Would Look Like in Practice

**User input:**
> "We want to strengthen independent journalism in Hungary to counter media capture and ensure citizens have access to reliable information."

**Strategy Wizard would:**

### 1. Extract preliminary understanding
- Detect that this is about media, Hungary, counter-autocracy context

### 2. Surface strategic blind spots:
- *Presupposition:* "You assume there's a market for independent news - is there?"
- *Gray Zone:* "Does 'independent' include outlets that are opposition-aligned but not nonpartisan?"
- *Unconfronted Challenge:* "What if Orbán wins the next election too?"

### 3. Generate intervention cards:
- "Core support to remaining independent outlets (Telex, 444, Átlátszó)"
- "Investigative journalism fund for cross-border collaboration"
- "Media literacy program in schools"

### 4. Generate precedent cards:
- "Poland's approach: Funding exile media. Outcome: Maintained diaspora audience but limited domestic reach"
- "Slovakia's approach: Fact-checking consortium. Outcome: Built trust but limited scale"

### 5. Generate alternative cards:
- "NOT funding: State broadcaster infiltration strategy (politically untenable)"
- "NOT funding: New outlet creation (market already saturated)"

### 6. Probe theory of change:
- "Your theory assumes citizens want independent media but can't access it. An alternative theory is that citizens have access but don't trust it. Which fits Hungary better?"

## Key Insight

This methodology would force strategic clarity through the same structured interrogation pattern:
- **Surfacing assumptions** (what you're taking for granted)
- **Probing blind spots** (what you haven't thought through)
- **Generating testable hypotheses** (intervention cards with clear logic)
- **Forcing differentiation from alternatives** (why THIS approach?)

The power is in the *methodology*, not the domain. The same staged adaptive questioning, blind spot categories, and card-based hypothesis validation can surface strategic clarity just as effectively as it surfaces conceptual clarity.

## Next Steps (if we proceed)

1. **Data Model** - Define schemas for Strategy, Intervention, Actor, Assumption, Risk cards
2. **Dimension Mapping** - Full prompts for each of the 12 strategic dimensions
3. **Question Bank** - Stage-specific questions with multiple choice options
4. **API Design** - Endpoints for strategy wizard workflow
5. **UI Components** - Adapt existing card components for strategy context
